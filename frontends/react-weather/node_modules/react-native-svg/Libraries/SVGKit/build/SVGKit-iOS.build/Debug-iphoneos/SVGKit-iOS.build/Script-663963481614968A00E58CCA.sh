#
# Version 2.3
#
# Latest Change:
# - Apple's handling of "project files" is broken; added a workaround for Xcode 4.5
# - Added automatic FAIL BUILD if any of the internal commands fail
# 
# Purpose:
#   Create a static library for iPhone from within XCode
#   Because Apple staff DELIBERATELY broke Xcode to make this impossible from the GUI (Xcode 3.2.3 specifically states this in the Release notes!)
#   ...no, I don't understand why they did this!

# Based on: original script from Eonil (main changes: Eonil's script WILL NOT WORK in Xcode GUI - it WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER)
